                    <p>This training program focuses on advanced techniques for defending and monitoring networks against cyber threats. Participants will learn about intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), network traffic analysis, and anomaly detection. The course covers advanced topics such as threat hunting, network forensics, and the use of machine learning in network security. Hands-on labs will provide practical experience in deploying and configuring IDPS, analyzing network traffic, and responding to advanced threats. By the end of the course, participants will be equipped with the skills to proactively defend their networks and respond to sophisticated cyber attacks.</p>
